      <h3>Welcome to Mindful Muscle, the one stop shop to building a new exercise routine.</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to building an exercise routine it can be difficult to 
        decide where to start. You can spend hours scouring the web to find an array 
        of varying information that is often incomplete or a one size fits all plan. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At Mindful Muscle we take out all the guess work! simply create a user, choose your goals, 
        choose how often you want to workout and choose what resources you have available. Once you 
        have made these selections, your dashboard will display a custom workout.
